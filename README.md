# USB3 Hub

My very own USB3 Hub with these features:

* Power to all ports controllable via USB
* Power to all ports controllable via switch
* Current measurement on half the ports
* Current readout either via display or USB

## WIP

This is very much work in progress. I have not yet finished routing
and there is no software whatsoever for the PCB, but I'm working on it.

## Schematics
